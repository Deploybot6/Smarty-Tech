## 📤 Deploying your bot on your own

If you can, it is preferable to host the files on your own server.

Doing this can lead to better uptime and more control over customization (you can modify the code for your usage).

You can deploy the PHP files on any website server with PHP installed or as a Heroku app.

### Step-by-step instructions for deploying to Heroku

1. Sign in to **Heroku** or create a new account at <https://heroku.com>
2. Click the "Deploy to Heroku" button below

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg "Deploy to Heroku")](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/DenverCoder1/readme-typing-svg/tree/main)

3. On the page that comes up, click **"Deploy App"** at the end of the form
4. Once the app is deployed, click **"Manage App"** to go to the dashboard
5. Scroll down to the **Domains** section in the settings to find the URL you will use in place of `readme-typing-svg.demolab.com`
